## ðŸš€ AI Assistant

The current version uses open-source LLM model **Llama3.2** to power the AI assistant in the sidebar.

In order to switch to a different model, simply change the `model` variable in `st_app.py`:

```python
model = "llama3.2"  # Change to your desired model name
```
But, before switching, ensure that the model is compatible with the `call_llama_func` function in `llama_utils.py`.
### Installation of Llama3.2
You can use the following command to install Llama3.2:

1. Go to the [llama GitHub repository](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)
2. Follow the installation instructions provided in the repository to set up Llama3.2 on your local machine.
3. You can install any other model by following the same steps, then customizing the `model` variable in `st_app.py`.
